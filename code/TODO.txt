* Implement a regression testing suite.

* Optimize the guard inference. It's taking too long
  on bubble sort.
  - Add a cache for evaluations of guards on stores.

* Add support for break/continue statements in Jminor.

* Add proper support for return statements.

* Add options to better control visualization (Graphviz vs. text),
  and the verbosity of printouts.
  
* Improve compression: support break/continue.

* Code generation bug: currently the codegens (Java/Dafny) emit two return statements. 

Guard inference:
----------------
* We can heuristically focus on a set of relevant basic propositions
  by conducting a value-dependence analysis on a trace.
  If, at a point in the trace, a value is not read in remainder of the trace,
  it is likely to be irrelevant at that point.
